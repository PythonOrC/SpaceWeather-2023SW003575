abstract="The magnetosphere and ionosphere are the space around the Earth into which satellites and space stations have been launched for precise positioning, long-distance communication, and various space experiments. Therefore, the space weather in this area has the most impact on human activities. In the space around the Earth, the geomagnetic field expands to form the magnetosphere, and the atmosphere of the Earth is partly ionized to produce a plasma, forming the ionosphere. Various space weather events occur in this region. Variations in the X-rays and ultraviolet emissions from the Sun and the ionospheric disturbances caused by atmospheric waves from the lower atmosphere induce positioning and communication problems and orbital changes in satellites. Variations in the solar wind plasma flow associated with flares and coronal holes on the solar surface can cause magnetic storms in the magnetosphere. These magnetic storms accelerate the radiation belt electrons around the Earth, resulting in satellite anomalies. Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) are caused to flow underground by the increased current flow in the magnetosphere and the ionosphere, affecting ground power grids. In this chapter, as an introduction to the following chapters, we briefly introduce the structures of the magnetosphere and the ionosphere and their variations and measurement techniques.",

abstract = {Protection of buried pipelines from corrosion constitutes an important objective to be taken into account in the design of pipelines networks. Most of the destructive processes which affect metals are of an electrochemical nature, mainly associated with the characteristics of the soils where they are buried. Protection methods usually involve the application of a non-corrosive coating over the pipes together with cathodic protection, which prevent the flow of ionic currents from the pipe to its surrounding soil. Nevertheless, these methods do not always compensate for the pipeline corrosion effects. In particular, during days of high geomagnetic activity and depending on the electrical conductivity of the host soil, excessive induced currents are channeled along the pipes which can override the protection measures. Within this framework, we present a study of electromagnetic induction in buried pipelines, assuming that geomagnetic storms are the external source responsible for the erratic currents. Our aim is to quantify the induction as a function of the characteristic of the soils and of the frequency and intensity of the inducing field in order to contribute to better understand and improve the pipeline corrosion protective methods. The results of our study indicate that geomagnetic effects can introduce significant disturbances on buried pipelines, increasing their risk of corrosion and potentially reducing their safe useful life.}

abstract = {Space weather describes the way in which the Sun, and conditions in space more generally, impact human activity and technology both in space and on the ground. It is now well understood that space weather represents a significant threat to infrastructure resilience, and is a source of risk that is wide-ranging in its impact and the pathways by which this impact may occur. Although space weather is growing rapidly as a field, work rigorously assessing the overall economic cost of space weather appears to be in its infancy. Here, we provide an initial literature review to gather and assess the quality of any published assessments of space weather impacts and socioeconomic studies. Generally speaking, there is a good volume of scientific peer-reviewed literature detailing the likelihood and statistics of different types of space weather phenomena. These phenomena all typically exhibit “power-law” behavior in their severity. The literature on documented impacts is not as extensive, with many case studies, but few statistical studies. The literature on the economic impacts of space weather is rather sparse and not as well developed when compared to the other sections, most probably due to the somewhat limited data that are available from end-users. The major risk is attached to power distribution systems and there is disagreement as to the severity of the technological footprint. This strongly controls the economic impact. Consequently, urgent work is required to better quantify the risk of future space weather events.},

The associated storm/substorm relationship problem is also reviewed. Although the physics of this relationship does not seem to be fully understood at this time, basic and fairly well established mechanisms of this relationship are presented and discussed. Finally, toward the advancement of geomagnetic storm research, some recommendations are given concerning future improvements in monitoring existing geomagnetic indices as well as the solar wind near Earth.},

abstract = {Many years of research have demonstrated that large, nonrecurrent geomagnetic storms, shock wave disturbances in the solar wind, and energetic particle events in interplanetary space often occur in close association with large solar flares. This result has led to a paradigm of cause and effect - that large solar flares are the fundamental cause of these events in the near-Earth space environment. This paradigm, which I call “the solar flare myth,” dominates the popular perception of the relationship between solar activity and interplanetary and geomagnetic events and has provided much of the pragmatic rationale for the study of the solar flare phenomenon. Yet there is good evidence that this paradigm is wrong and that flares do not generally play a central role in producing major transient disturbances in the near-Earth space environment. In this paper I outline a different paradigm of cause and effect that removes solar flares from their central position in the chain of events leading from the Sun to near-Earth space. Instead, this central role is given to events known as coronal mass ejections.},

The CME near the Sun had a sky-plane speed of ∼1660 km/s, but the associated magnetic cloud (MC) arrived with a speed of only 730 km/s. The MC at 1 AU (ACE Observations) had a high magnetic field (∼56 nT) and high inclination to the ecliptic plane. The southward component of the MC's magnetic field was made up almost entirely of its axial field because of its east-south-west (ESW) chirality. We suggest that the southward pointing strong axial field of the MC reconnected with Earth's front-side magnetic field, resulting in the largest storm of the solar cycle 23.},

abstract = {Coronal mass ejection events (CMEs) are important occasional sources of plasma and magnetic field in the solar wind at 1 AU, accounting for approximately 10\% of all solar wind measurements in the ecliptic plane during the last solar activity maximum. Previous work indicates that virtually all transient shock wave disturbances in the solar wind are driven by fast CMEs. Using a recently appreciated capability for distinguishing CMEs in solar wind data in the form of counterstreaming solar wind electron events, this paper explores the overall effectiveness of shock wave disturbances and CMEs in general in stimulating geomagnetic activity. The study is confined to the interval from mid-August 1978 through mid-October 1982, spanning the last solar activity maximum, when ISEE 3 was in orbit about the L1 Lagrange point 220 Re upstream from Earth. We find that all but one of the 37 largest geomagnetic storms in that era were associated with Earth passage of CMEs and/or shock disturbances, with the large majority of these storms (27 out of 37) being associated with interplanetary events where Earth encountered both a shock and the CME driving the shock (shock/CME events). Although CMEs and/or shock disturbances were increasingly the cause of geomagnetic activity as the level of geomagnetic activity increased, many smaller geomagnetic disturbances were unrelated to these events. Further, approximately half of all CMEs and half of all shock disturbances encountered by Earth did not produce any substantial geomagnetic activity as measured by the planetary geomagnetic index Kp. The geomagnetic effectiveness of Earth directed CMEs and shock wave disturbances was directly related to the flow speed, the magnetic field magnitude, and the strength of the southward (GSM) field component associated with the events. The initial speed of a CME close to the Sun appears to be the most crucial factor in determining if an earthward directed event will be effective in exciting a large geomagnetic disturbance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the solar origin and interplanetary consequences of the coronal mass ejection of March 29, 2001 that was responsible for the most intense geomagnetic storm (DST ∼ −377 nT) of the current solar cycle to date. A comparison of the CME of March 29, 2001, with a set of geo-effective halo CMEs associated with X-class flares showed that the strength of the geomagnetic storm at the earth is well correlated with the speed of the halo. Our study shows that the fast ejection is responsible for building up the ram pressure at the earth's magnetosphere. This may serve as a useful tool in the forecasting of intense geomagnetic storms.},

abstract = {An algorithm is presented for predicting the ground-based Dst index solely from a knowledge of the velocity and density of the solar wind and the north-south solar magnetospheric component of the interplanetary magnetic field. The three key elements of this model are an adjustment for solar wind dynamic pressure, an injection rate linearly proportional to the dawn-to-dusk component of the interplanetary electric field which is zero for electric fields below 0.5 mV m−1, and an exponential decay rate of the ring current with an e folding time of 7.7 hours. The algorithm is used to predict the Dst signature of seven geomagnetic storm intervals in 1967 and 1968. In addition to being quite successful, considering the simplicity of the model, the algorithm pinpoints the causes of various types of storm behavior. A main phase is initiated whenever the dawn-to-dusk solar magnetospheric component of the interplanetary electric field becomes large and positive. It is preceded by an initial phase of increased Dst if the solar wind dynamic pressure increases suddenly prior to the main phase. The recovery phase is initiated when the injection rate governed by the interplanetary electric field drops below the ring current decay rate associated with the ring current strength built up during the main phase. Variable recovery rates are generally due to additional injection during the recovery phase. This one algorithm accounts for magnetospheric behavior at quiet and at disturbed times and seems capable of predicting the behavior of Dst during even the largest of storms.},

abstract = {Abstract Maps of extreme value geoelectric field amplitude are constructed for the Mid-Atlantic United States, a region with high population density and critically important power grid infrastructure. Geoelectric field time series for the years 1983–2014 are estimated by convolving Earth surface impedances obtained from 61 magnetotelluric survey sites across the Mid-Atlantic with historical 1 min (2 min Nyquist) measurements of geomagnetic variation obtained from a nearby observatory. Statistical models are fitted to the maximum geoelectric amplitudes occurring during magnetic storms, and extrapolations made to estimate threshold amplitudes only exceeded, on average, once per century. For the Mid-Atlantic region, 100 year geoelectric exceedance amplitudes have a range of almost 3 orders of magnitude (from 0.04 V/km at a site in southern Pennsylvania to 24.29 V/km at a site in central Virginia), and they have significant geographic granularity, all of which is due to site-to-site differences in magnetotelluric impedance. Maps of these 100 year exceedance amplitudes resemble those of the estimated geoelectric amplitudes attained during the March 1989 magnetic storm, and, in that sense, the March 1989 storm resembles what might be loosely called a “100 year” event. The geoelectric hazard maps reported here stand in stark contrast with the 100 year geoelectric benchmarks developed for the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.},

abstract = {Halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) had been rarely reported in coronagraph observations of the Sun before the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. Since mid-1996, however, the SOHO Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instruments have observed many halo or partial-halo CMEs. A halo CME, especially when associated with solar activity near sun center, is important for space weather concerns because it suggests the launch of a potentially geoeffective disturbance toward Earth. During the post-solar minimum period from December 1996 to June 1997, we found that all six halo CMEs that were likely Earthward-directed were associated with shocks, magnetic clouds, and moderate geomagnetic storms at Earth 3–5 days later. The results imply that magnetic cloud-like structures are a general characteristic of CMEs. Most of the storms were driven by strong, sustained southward fields either in the magnetic clouds, in the post-shock region, or both. We discuss the characteristics of the halo events observed during this period, their associated signatures near the solar surface, and their usefulness as predictors of space weather at Earth.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to summarize the current understanding of the storm/substorm relationship by clearing up a considerable amount of controversy and by addressing the question of how solar wind energy is deposited into and is dissipated in the constituent elements that are critical to magnetospheric and ionospheric processes during magnetic storms. (1) Four mechanisms are identified and discussed as the primary causes of enhanced electric fields in the interplanetary medium responsible for geomagnetic storms. It is pointed out that in reality, these four mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive, but interdependent, interact differently from event to event. Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs) are found to be the primary phenomena responsible for the main phase of geomagnetic storms. The other two mechanisms, i.e., HILDCAA (high-intensity, long-duration, continuous auroral electrojet activity) and the so-called Russell-McPherron effect, work to make the ICME and CIR phenomena more geoeffective. The solar cycle dependence of the various sources in creating magnetic storms has yet to be quantitatively understood. (2) A serious controversy exists as to whether the successive occurrence of intense substorms plays a direct role in the energization of ring current particles or whether the enhanced electric field associated with southward IMF enhances the effect of substorm expansions. While most of the Dst variance during magnetic storms can be solely reproduced by changes in the large-scale electric field in the solar wind and the residuals are uncorrelated with substorms, recent satellite observations of the ring current constituents during the main phase of magnetic storms show the importance of ionospheric ions. This implies that ionospheric ions, which are associated with the frequent occurrence of intense substorms, are accelerated upward along magnetic field lines, contributing to the energy density of the storm-time ring current. An apparently new controversy regarding the relative importance of the two processes is thus created. It is important to identify the role of substorm occurrence in the large-scale enhancement of magnetospheric convection driven by solar wind electric fields. (3) Numerical schemes for predicting geomagnetic activity indices on the basis of solar/solar wind/interplanetary magnetic field parameters continue to be upgraded, ensuring reliable techniques for forecasting magnetic storms under real-time conditions. There is a need to evaluate the prediction capability of geomagnetic indices on the basis of physical processes that occur during storm time substorms. (4) It is crucial to differentiate between storms and nonstorm time substorms in terms of energy transfer/conversion processes, i.e., mechanical energy from the solar wind, electromagnetic energy in the magnetotail, and again, mechanical energy of particles in the plasma sheet, ring current, and aurora. To help answer the question of the role of substorms in energizing ring current particles, it is crucial to find efficient magnetospheric processes that heat ions up to some minimal energies so that they can have an effect on the strength of the storm time ring current. (5) The question of whether the Dst index is an accurate and effective measure of the storm time ring current is also controversial. In particular, it is demonstrated that the dipolarization effect associated with substorm expansion acts to reduce the Dst magnitude, even though the ring current may still be growing.},

abstract = {Abstract Geomagnetic observations play a crucial role in the monitoring of space weather events. In a modern society relying on the efficient functioning of its technology network such observations are important in order to determine the potential hazard for activities and infrastructure. Until recently, it was the perception that geomagnetic storms had no or very little adverse effect on radio communication and electric power infrastructure at middle- and low-latitude regions like southern Africa. The 2003 Halloween storm changed this perception. In this paper we discuss the role of the geomagnetic observation network operated by the South African National Space Agency (SANSA) in space weather monitoring. The primary objective is to describe the geomagnetic data sets available to characterize and monitor the various types of solar-driven disturbances, with the aim to better understand the physics of these processes in the near-Earth space environment and to provide relevant space weather monitoring and prediction.},

abstract = {On 28 October 2003 an extreme solar flare with significant increases in the EUV and X-ray flux caused increased photoionization effects in the dayside ionosphere and determined a remarkable solar flare effect (SFE) manifestation that preceded Halloween storm. An analysis conducted at 53 stations revealed that the geomagnetic disturbance had greatest amplitude and longest duration at lowest latitudes in the dayside hemisphere, and its characteristics were basically controlled by the zenith angle of the observing stations. The aspects of the SFE onset and initial phase reveal a close correspondence with those of the EUV flux. At equatorial/electrojet latitudes, the SFE manifestation can be mostly interpreted in terms of a significant enhancement of the preflare current system during normal electrojet conditions, with some evidence for a highly confined counter electrojet in the dawn sector. Additional elements, at higher latitudes, might suggest in these regions a more significant role of the X-ray flux and the onset of additional currents below the normal dynamo current region.},

A number of studies have also shown space weather to impact power networks at lower latitudes, although most of these studies show increases in GIC activity within networks not directly related to hardware faults. This study examines a GIC event that occurred in New Zealand's South Island power network on 6th November 2001. A transformer failure that occurred during this day is shown to be associated with a change in the solar wind dynamic pressure of nearly 20 nPa. Measurements of GICs recorded on the neutral lines of transformers across the Transpower network during this event show good correlation with a GIC-index, a proxy for the geoelectric field that drives GIC. Comparison of this event with GIC activity observed in the Transpower network during large space weather storms such as the “2003 Halloween storm,” suggests that solar wind shocks and associated geomagnetic sudden impulse (SI) events may be as hazardous to middle latitude power networks as GIC activity occurring during the main phase of large storms. Further, this study suggests that the latitudinal dependence of the impacts of SI events on power systems differs from that observed during large main phase storms. This study also highlights the importance of operating procedures for large space weather events, even at middle latitude locations.},

These “Halloween storms” damaged 28 satellites, knocking two out of commission, diverted airplane routes, and caused power failures in Sweden, among other problems. This paper presents a 4-day end-to-end simulation of one of the major events (following the X17 flare) that produced the most geoeffective interval of the Halloween storm. The simulation was carried out with the newly developed Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF, see http://csem.engin.umich.edu/SWMF) that self-consistently couples physical domain models spanning from the solar corona to the upper atmosphere. The various attempts and iterations leading to the final simulation are also described. We briefly discuss the technological advances enabling the faster than real-time operation of the SWMF with the required high resolution. We compare the simulation results with observations from space- and ground-based measurements. We have also performed a reference magnetospheric simulation driven by ACE and Geotail observations and compared its results with the Sun-to-thermosphere simulation and the magnetospheric observations. The magnetic structure of the coronal mass ejection (CME) observed at the L1 point on the ACE spacecraft is not correctly reproduced because of the insufficient observations and theoretical understanding of the CME initiation mechanism. On the other hand, we find that the SWMF reasonably well reproduced both the hydrodynamic characteristics of the coronal mass ejection and some of the major indexes characterizing the strength of the geomagnetic storms.},
