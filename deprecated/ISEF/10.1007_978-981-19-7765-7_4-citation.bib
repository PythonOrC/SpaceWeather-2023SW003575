abstract="The magnetosphere and ionosphere are the space around the Earth into which satellites and space stations have been launched for precise positioning, long-distance communication, and various space experiments. Therefore, the space weather in this area has the most impact on human activities. In the space around the Earth, the geomagnetic field expands to form the magnetosphere, and the atmosphere of the Earth is partly ionized to produce a plasma, forming the ionosphere. Various space weather events occur in this region. Variations in the X-rays and ultraviolet emissions from the Sun and the ionospheric disturbances caused by atmospheric waves from the lower atmosphere induce positioning and communication problems and orbital changes in satellites. Variations in the solar wind plasma flow associated with flares and coronal holes on the solar surface can cause magnetic storms in the magnetosphere. These magnetic storms accelerate the radiation belt electrons around the Earth, resulting in satellite anomalies. Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) are caused to flow underground by the increased current flow in the magnetosphere and the ionosphere, affecting ground power grids. In this chapter, as an introduction to the following chapters, we briefly introduce the structures of the magnetosphere and the ionosphere and their variations and measurement techniques.",
